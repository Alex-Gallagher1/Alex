	- gravitational lensing
	- Composite Nosecone Bending
	- Main Sequence Stars
	- "confirming" Initial mass function
	- selsic index of galaxies

	- https://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/debcat/ - This source contains a table with different information for different types of stars which can be used to track different star relationships
	- https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/castles/ - Database of known gravitational lenses and relevant data such as redshift and more
	- https://arxiv.org/html/2501.08510v1#S2 - paper on measuring and validating the IMF function for star formation

	- for the gravitational lensing I could use loops to go through and find the values of distance for the source and the lens, then I could go through and use the lens equation to find the mass of each lens. 

4. 
	- One project Idea that would be slightly ambitious is trying to confirm the selsic index of different galaxy types by plotting the data for several galaxies and using curve fit to fit for the selsic index
	- Another project would be taking the data of stars in the database and using that to plot the stars on the HR diagram to see the association of the main sequence stars, im not too sure if this one is senough and am not sure where to go from there
